    { question: "How does the volume-based pricing work? Do I pay less if I process more orders?", answer: "Some of our flexible models link your platform fee to your processed order volume. In these scenarios, as your volume grows, the effective platform cost per order can decrease, ensuring the pricing scales fairly with your success. Contact us for details specific to your volume." },

Our standard plans typically involve a monthly subscription fee and integrated payment processing rates. We clearly outline costs upfront, and there are no hidden setup fees for standard onboarding." },
